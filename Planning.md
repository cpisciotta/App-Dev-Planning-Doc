## About the App

### Description

In this section, take the time to describe your app at a high level. You should be able to describe your app in about a paragraph here. If you're having trouble describing it in a concise manner, that's probably a signal that you should spend extra time editing this section. The internal team and especially external users should be able to understand the core functionality of your app in less than 1 minute. This section will help you understand and steer the decisions being made to ensure that they align with the mission of the app. Best of all, this section can help you in writing your app's description on the app store or product page where it's deployed.
