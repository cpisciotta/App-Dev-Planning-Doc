## Making it Yours

It's recommended that you use GitHub's native editor or a text editor. Using Git and GitHub will allow you to easily share this with your development team, track changes, and integrate it with your product repositories.

## Publishing this document.

It's recommended that you use a Markdown to PDF converter when your document is complete or is sent outside of your team. Visual Studio Code has a great [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf) to convert your Markdown file to PDF format. This will make it easier to read and share.
